# surgical_preassessment
An OpenEHR template for Surgical Pre-Assessment.
Began life at the <a href="https://www.scata.org.uk/workinggroups.php">SCATA Open Standards Working Group</a> meeting in Belfast in February 2019.<br/>
Credits to Ian McNicoll and Marand for use of Archetype Designer.<br/>
Credit also to Graeme Hilditch and team at QEUH in Glasgow for sharing their data set which has been used as an initial guide to the design of the template.<br/>
This template is a work in progress and covers a very limited subset of elements in the assessment.
Currently there is some effort to align concepts from the HL7 Anesthesia pre-assessment DAM, a copy of which can be found here:
